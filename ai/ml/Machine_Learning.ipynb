        "## Features\n",
        "\n",
        "A __feature__ is an input variable - the `x` variable in simple linera regression. A simple machine learning project might use a single feature, while a more sophisticated machine learning project could use millions of features, specified as:\n",

        "* __Inference__ means applying the trained model to unlabeled examples. That is, you use the trained model to make useful predictions (`y'`). For example, during __inference__, you can predict __MedianHouseValue__ for new unlabeled examples.\n",
