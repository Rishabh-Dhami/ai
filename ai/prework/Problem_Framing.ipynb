    "__Problem framing__ is the process of analyzing a problem to isolate the individual elements that need to be addressed to solve it. Problem framing helps determine your project's technical feasibility and provides a clear set of goals and success criteria. When considering an ML solution, effective problem framing can determine whether or not your product ultimately succeeds.\n",

    "\n",
    "Data is the driving force of ML. To make good [predictions](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#prediction), you need data that contains [features](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#feature) with predictive power. Your data should have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Abundant.__ The more relevant and useful examples in your [dataset](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#data-set-or-dataset), the better your model will be.\n",
    "* __Consistent and reliable.__ Having data that's consistently and reliably collected will produce a better model. For example, an ML-based weather model will benefit from data gathered over many years from the same reliable instruments.\n",
    "* __Trusted.__ Understand where your data will come from. Will the data be from trusted sources you control, like logs from your product, or will it be from sources you don't have much insight into, like the output from another ML system?\n",
    "* __Available.__ Make sure all inputs are available at prediction time in the correct format. If it will be difficult to obtain certain feature values at prediction time, omit those features from your datasets.\n",
    "* __Correct.__ In large datasets, it's inevitable that some [labels](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#label) will have incorrect values, but if more than a small percentage of [labels](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#label) are incorrect, the model will produce poor predictions.\n",
    "* __Representative.__ The datasets should be as representative of the real world as possible. In other words, the datasets should accurately reflect the events, user behaviors, and/or the phenomena of the real world being modeled. Training on unrepresentative datasets can cause poor performance when the model is asked to make real-world predictions.\n",

    "### Predictive power\n",
    "\n",
    "For a model to make good predictions, the features in your dataset should have predictive power. The more correlated a feature is with a label, the more likely it is to predict it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some features will have more predictive power than others. For example, in a weather dataset, features such as `cloud_coverage`, `temperature`, and `dew_point` would be better predictors of rain than `moon_phase` or `day_of_week`. For the video app example, you could hypothesize that features such as `video_description`, `length` and `views` might be good predictors for which videos a user would want to watch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that a feature's predictive power can change because the context or domain changes. For example, in the video app, a feature like `upload_date` might—in general—be weakly correlated with the label. However, in the sub-domain of gaming videos, `upload_date` might be strongly correlated with the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining which features have predictive power can be a time consuming process. You can manually explore a feature's predictive power by removing and adding it while training a model. You can automate finding a feature's predictive power by using algorithms such as [Pearson correlation](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient), [Adjusted mutual information (AMI)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjusted_mutual_information), and [Shapley value](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value#In_machine_learning), which provide a numerical assessment for analyzing the predictive power of a feature.\n",

    "## Implementing a model\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing a model, start simple. Most of the work in ML is on the data side, so getting a full pipeline running for a complex model is harder than iterating on the model itself. After setting up your data pipeline and implementing a simple model that uses a few features, you can iterate on creating a better model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple models provide a good baseline, even if you don't end up launching them. In fact, using a model is probably better than you think. Starting simple helps you determine whether or not a complex model is even justified."

    "### Train your own model versus using a pre-trained model\n",
    "\n",
    "Many pre-trained models exist for a variety of use cases and offer many advantages. However, pre-trained models only really work when the label and features match your dataset exactly. For example, if a pre-trained model uses 25 features and your dataset only includes 24 of them, the pre-trained model will most likely make bad predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly, ML practitioners use matching subsections of inputs from a pre-trained model for fine-tuning or transfer learning. If a pre-trained model doesn't exist for your particular use case, consider using subsections from a pre-trained model when training your own.\n",

    "\n",
    "If any of the incoming features used for inference have values that fall outside the distribution range of the data used in training, you'll want to be alerted because it's likely the model will make poor predictions. For example, if your model was trained to predict temperatures for equatorial cities at sea level, then your serving system should alert you of incoming data with latitudes and longitudes, and/or altitudes outside the range the model was trained on. Conversely, the serving system should alert you if the model is making predictions that are outside the distribution range that was seen during training.\n",
