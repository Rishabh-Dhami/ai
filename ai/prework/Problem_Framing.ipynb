    "__Problem framing__ is the process of analyzing a problem to isolate the individual elements that need to be addressed to solve it. Problem framing helps determine your project's technical feasibility and provides a clear set of goals and success criteria. When considering an ML solution, effective problem framing can determine whether or not your product ultimately succeeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Formal problem framing is the critical beginning for solving an ML problem, as it forces us to better understand both the problem and the data in order to design and build a bridge between them. - _TensorFlow engineer_\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, ML problem framing consists of two distinct steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determining whether ML is a right approach for solving a problem.\n",
    "2. Framing the problem in ML terms.\n",

    "### Clear use case for ML\n",
    "\n",
    "Some view ML as a universal tool that can be applied to all problems. In reality, ML is a specialized tool suitable only for particular problems. You don't want to implement a complex ML solution when a simpler non-ML solution will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "To confirm that ML is the right approach, first verify that your current non-ML solution is optimized. If you don't have a non-ML solution implemented, try solving the problem manually using a [__heuristic__](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#heuristic).\n",
    "\n",
    "The non-ML solution is the benchmark you'll use to determine whether ML is a good use case for your problem. Consider the following questions when comparing a non-ML approach to an ML one:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Quality:__ How much better do you think an ML solution can be? If you think an ML solution might be only a small improvement, that might indicate the current solution is the best one.\n",
    "* __Cost and maintenance:__ How expensive is the ML solution in both the short- and long-term? In some cases, it costs significantly more in terms of compute resources and time to implement ML. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "  * Can the ML solution justify the increase in cost? Note that small improvements in large systems can easily justify the cost and maintenance of implementing an ML solution.\n",
    "  * How much maintenance will the solution require? In many cases, ML implementations need dedicated long-term maintenance.\n",
    "  * Does your product have the resources to support training or hiring people with ML expertise?\n",

    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is the driving force of ML. To make good [predictions](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#prediction), you need data that contains [features](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#feature) with predictive power. Your data should have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Abundant.__ The more relevant and useful examples in your [dataset](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#data-set-or-dataset), the better your model will be.\n",
    "* __Consistent and reliable.__ Having data that's consistently and reliably collected will produce a better model. For example, an ML-based weather model will benefit from data gathered over many years from the same reliable instruments.\n",
    "* __Trusted.__ Understand where your data will come from. Will the data be from trusted sources you control, like logs from your product, or will it be from sources you don't have much insight into, like the output from another ML system?\n",
    "* __Available.__ Make sure all inputs are available at prediction time in the correct format. If it will be difficult to obtain certain feature values at prediction time, omit those features from your datasets.\n",
    "* __Correct.__ In large datasets, it's inevitable that some [labels](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#label) will have incorrect values, but if more than a small percentage of [labels](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#label) are incorrect, the model will produce poor predictions.\n",
    "* __Representative.__ The datasets should be as representative of the real world as possible. In other words, the datasets should accurately reflect the events, user behaviors, and/or the phenomena of the real world being modeled. Training on unrepresentative datasets can cause poor performance when the model is asked to make real-world predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can't get the data you need in the required format, your model will make poor predictions."

    "### Predictive power\n",
    "\n",
    "For a model to make good predictions, the features in your dataset should have predictive power. The more correlated a feature is with a label, the more likely it is to predict it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some features will have more predictive power than others. For example, in a weather dataset, features such as `cloud_coverage`, `temperature`, and `dew_point` would be better predictors of rain than `moon_phase` or `day_of_week`. For the video app example, you could hypothesize that features such as `video_description`, `length` and `views` might be good predictors for which videos a user would want to watch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that a feature's predictive power can change because the context or domain changes. For example, in the video app, a feature like `upload_date` might—in general—be weakly correlated with the label. However, in the sub-domain of gaming videos, `upload_date` might be strongly correlated with the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining which features have predictive power can be a time consuming process. You can manually explore a feature's predictive power by removing and adding it while training a model. You can automate finding a feature's predictive power by using algorithms such as [Pearson correlation](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient), [Adjusted mutual information (AMI)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjusted_mutual_information), and [Shapley value](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value#In_machine_learning), which provide a numerical assessment for analyzing the predictive power of a feature.\n",

    "\n",
    "You think a regression model is the right approach because you'll be predicting a numeric value — the number of views. However, when training the regression model, you realize that it produces the same loss for a prediction of 28 and 32 for videos that have 30 views. In other words, although your app will have very different behavior if the prediction is 28 versus 32, the model considers both predictions equally good.\n",

    "This scenario highlights two important points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Predict the decision.__ When possible, predict the decision your app will take. In the video example, a classification model would predict the decision if the categories it classified videos into were \"no cache\", \"cheap cache\", and \"expensive cache.\" Hiding your app's behavior from the model can cause your app to produce the wrong behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Understand the problem's constraints.__ If your app takes different actions based on different thresholds, determine if those thresholds are fixed or dynamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * __Dynamic thresholds:__ If thresholds are dynamic, use a regression model and set the thresholds limits in your app's code. This lets you easily update the thresholds while still having the model make reasonable predictions.\n",
    "  * __Fixed thresholds:__ If thresholds are fixed, use a classification model and label your datasets based on the threshold limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, most cache provisioning is dynamic and the thresholds change over time. Therefore, because this is specifically a caching problem, a regression model is the best choice. However, for many problems, the thresholds will be fixed, making a classification model the best solution."
