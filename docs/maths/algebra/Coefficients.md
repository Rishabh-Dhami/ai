# Coefficient

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), a __coefficient__ is a multiplicative factor in some [term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summand) of a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial), a [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics)), or an [expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics)); it is usually a number, but may be any expression (including variables such as $a$, $b$, and $c$). When the coefficients are themselves [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)), they may also be called as [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter).

For example, the polynomial $2x^2 - x + 3$ has coefficients $2$, $-1$, and $3$, and the powers of the variable $x$ in the polynomial $ax^2 + bx + c$ have coefficient parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$.

The __constant coefficient__ (also known as the __constant term__, __free coefficient__) is the coefficient not attached to variables in an expression. For example, the constant coefficients of the parameters above are the number $3$ and the parameter $c$, respectively. The coefficient attached to the highest degree of the variable in a polynomial such that it is not equals to $0$, is referred to as the __leading coefficient__. For example, in the above expression the leading coefficients are the number $2$ and the parameter $a$, respectively.

## Linear Algebra

In [Linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra), a [system of linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations) is frequently represented by its [coefficient matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_matrix). For example, the system of equations

$
\begin{cases}
2x + 3y = 0, \\
5x - 4y = 0
\end{cases}
$

the associated coefficient matrix is
$
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 3 \\
5 & -4
\end{pmatrix}
$
. Coefficient matrices are used in algorithms such as [Gussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination) and [Cramer's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule) to find solutions to the system.

The __leading entry__ (sometimes $\mathrm{leading\ coefficient}^\mathrm{[citation\ needed]}$) of a row in a matrix is the first nonzero entry in that row. So, for example, in the matrix

$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 0 & 6 \\
0 & 2 & 9 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$
,

the leading coefficient of the first row is $1$, that of the second row is $2$; that of the third row is $4$, while the last row does not have a leading coefficient.
