# Coefficient

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), a __coefficient__ is a multiplicative factor in some [term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summand) of a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial), a [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics)), or an [expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics)); it is usually a number, but may be any expression (including variables such as $a$, $b$, and $c$). When the coefficients are themselves [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)), they may also be called as [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter).

For example, the polynomial $2x^2 - x + 3$ has coefficients $2$, $-1$, and $3$, and the powers of the variable $x$ in the polynomial $ax^2 + bx + c$ have coefficient parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$.

The __constant coefficient__ (also known as the __constant term__, __free coefficient__) is the coefficient not attached to variables in an expression. For example, the constant coefficients of the parameters above are the number $3$ and the parameter $c$, respectively. The coefficient attached to the highest degree of the variable in a polynomial is referred to as the __leading coefficient__. For example, in the above expression the leading coefficients are the number $2$ and the parameter $a$, respectively.
